t- Input and Output Streams in Java

we have input source and output destination. the way that input source sends the data to the Destination via Streams.
data to one and zero and that data travel as streams.
A program uses as Input stream to read data from a source, one item at a time.
A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination, one item at a time.
Stream can handle all kind of data from primitive values to advanced objects.
